/**
 * Tenancy model.
 *
 * DESIGN DECISIONS (made, not asked — overrule any of these and I'll change it)
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **Shared schema with a `tenant_id` column**, not schema-per-tenant or
 * database-per-tenant. Shared schema is the right default here: it keeps
 * migrations to one operation, keeps the Enterprise self-hosted build identical
 * to the cloud build, and scales to thousands of tenants without a connection
 * pool per customer. Customers who genuinely cannot share a database get the
 * self-hosted edition, which is a single-tenant deployment of the same code.
 *
 * **Isolation is enforced by the type system, not by discipline.** Every scoped
 * store method takes `TenantId` as its first parameter. There is no overload
 * that omits it. A route that forgets to scope a query does not leak data — it
 * fails to compile. This is the whole reason to do tenancy at the store layer
 * rather than by adding `WHERE tenant_id = ?` at call sites and hoping.
 *
 * **The tenant is derived from the session, never from the request.** A
 * `tenantId` in a request body is an attacker's field. It is not read anywhere.
 *
 * **One audit chain per tenant.** A global chain would mean a tenant verifying
 * their own history needs entries belonging to other tenants, and the sequence
 * numbers would leak other customers' activity volume. Per-tenant chains are
 * independently verifiable and leak nothing.
 *
 * **One user belongs to one tenant.** Multi-org membership is a real
 * requirement eventually, but it changes the session model (which org am I
 * acting as?) and the UI. Deferred deliberately; the schema puts the
 * relationship on the user row so it can become a join table later without
 * touching anything that reads it.
