# V12 Apex Atlas — self-hosted / Enterprise edition image.

# Multi-stage so the runtime image carries no build toolchain and no dev
# dependencies. The runtime stage installs production deps only, which matters
# more than usual here: the dev tree includes Playwright and Babel, and neither
# belongs on a production server.

# better-sqlite3 compiles a native addon; the toolchain is thrown away with
# this stage. It is an OPTIONAL dependency, so if the compile fails — no
# prebuild for this platform, no network to fetch node headers — npm carries on
# and the image simply ships without the SQLite driver. That is a supported
# configuration: it runs on Postgres. Verified by building and booting a tree
# where better-sqlite3 genuinely failed to install.
#
# Do NOT add --omit=optional here: it would also drop Rollup's native binary and
# break the client build.
